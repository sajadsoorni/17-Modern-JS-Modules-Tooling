# Modern JavaScript Development: Modules, Tooling, and Functional (Practice Repository)

This repository contains my practice work for **Section 17: Modern JavaScript Development: Modules, Tooling, and Functional** from Jonas Schmedtmann‚Äôs [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

I created this repository to follow Jonas‚Äôs lectures and push my practice work as separate branches for each lecture in this section.

## üìö About This Section  
This section focuses on the **real-world development process** of building modern JavaScript applications using modern tools and workflows.

### Key Topics:
- **Modules (ES Modules)** for organized, maintainable code.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)** to manage dependencies and tools.
- **Build Process**: Bundling, transpiling (Babel), and polyfilling for browser compatibility.
- **Bundlers**: Using **Parcel** (zero-config) and an intro to **Webpack**.
- **Development Tools**: Live-server, Parcel, Babel, and others from the NPM ecosystem.
